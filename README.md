MEMORY / 25-12-25

Dear December, 

I hope you’re going to become a better person, fixing all your flaws and manage through the hard times. 

All my friends love me in some way or another and I’m grateful for that.

I'm always looking for more even though I never appreciate what I have. Still, it feels weird. I really wish I could do so many things, I’m jealous of a lot of people.

Wealth and Financial Freedom really does make you think do we live in a society where the rich gets prioritized simply for having more money than someone else, even if that person somewhat have a decent amount of money ?

I try my best to do what I am capable of doing. That isn’t the matter, money can’t buy friendship or love, and never will ;

I love you all, I never appreciated my loved ones and friends enough ;

To receive, we should first give, right ?

We love you <3
