Dear December,

I hope you’re going to become a better person, fixing all your flaws and manage through the hard times. To be real with you, I haven’t been the same since I changed schools ; I changed my whole self I tried to fit in ands till be unique. 

It worked partly, I am still loved and appreciated, I simply feel not my full M E. All my friends love me in some way or another and I’m grateful for that, yet I hate how I never get included in anyone’s plan for that matter.

I wish I could talk more to the cool people I see during breaks, I simply glance at them and do nothing. Why do I have friends but still feel lonely ?

Im always looking for more even though I never appreciate what I have, that’s why.Do something, don’t be a greedy mf. Still, it feels weird. I really wish I could do so manythings, I’m jealous of a lot of people.

Wealth and Financial Freedom really does make you think dowe live in a society where the rich gets prioritized simply for having more money than someone else, even if that person somewhat have a decent amount of money ?

I try my best to do what I am capable of doing. That isn’t the matter, money can’t buy friendship or love, and never will ;

I love you all, I never appreciated my loved and friends enough ;

To receive, we should first give, right ?

We love you <3
